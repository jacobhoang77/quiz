# quiz
Implementation:
The core functionalities include:


A "fake" login system prompting for a username and a math-based security question.


Dynamic question display with immediate feedback on answers.


Score tracking and a final score display upon quiz completion.


A CSS-styled interface with a black theme and responsive design for accessibility across devices.


Challenges


Authentication Logic: Implementing the pseudo-authentication was tricky, especially integrating it seamlessly before quiz start.


Dynamic Content: Dynamically updating the quiz content and feedback without reloading the page required careful state management.


CSS Styling: Ensuring a consistent theme while providing clear feedback for correct/incorrect answers was a meticulous process.
